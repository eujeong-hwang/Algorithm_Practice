What is a Hash Table?

    Hash tables are a type of data structure in which the address or the index value of the data element is generated from a hash function. That makes accessing the data faster as the index value behaves as a key for the data value. In other words Hash table stores key-value pairs but the key is generated through a hashing function.

# In Python, the Dictionary data types represent the implementation of hash tables.
