## What is a Hash Table?

    - Hash tables are a type of data structure in which the address or the index value of the data element is generated from a hash function. 
    - That makes accessing the data faster as the index value behaves as a key for the data value. 
    - In other words Hash table stores key-value pairs but the key is generated through a hashing function.
    - In Python, the **Dictionary** data types represent the implementation of hash tables.


## What is a Dictionary?

    - Dictionary in Python is an **unordered collection of data values**, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. 
    -Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized.
