## Question
    Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

    A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

## Example
    Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

## My code
```
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
      max_sum = 0
      max_ending_here = 0

      for i in nums:
          max_ending_here += i
          # reset max_ending_here to 0 if it is negative
          # _this_ because we can use the max(nums) to find _out_ the largest negative num
          if max_ending_here < 0:
              max_ending_here = 0
          # _set_ the max_mum to be max_ending_here if max_ending_here is more than max_sum
          # this means that max_ending_here contains positive number and we need to keep track of them
          if max_ending_here > max_sum:
              max_sum = max_ending_here
      # return max_sum if it is not zero, otherwise return the largest single maximum number
      return max_sum if max_sum != 0 else max(nums)              
```
