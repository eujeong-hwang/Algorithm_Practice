## Question
    Table: Person

    +-------------+---------+
    | Column Name | Type    |
    +-------------+---------+
    | id          | int     |
    | email       | varchar |
    +-------------+---------+
    id is the primary key column for this table.
    Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.

<br>

    Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id. Note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

    Return the result table in any order.

    The query result format is in the following example.

## Example
    Input: 
    Person table:
    +----+------------------+
    | id | email            |
    +----+------------------+
    | 1  | john@example.com |
    | 2  | bob@example.com  |
    | 3  | john@example.com |
    +----+------------------+
    Output: 
    +----+------------------+
    | id | email            |
    +----+------------------+
    | 1  | john@example.com |
    | 2  | bob@example.com  |
    +----+------------------+
    Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.

## MySQL query statement
```
DELETE p2.*
FROM Person AS p1, Person AS p2
WHERE p1.email = p2.email AND p1.Id < p2.Id
```
