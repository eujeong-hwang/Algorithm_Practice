https://leetcode.com/problems/classes-more-than-5-students/

## Question

    Table: Courses

    +-------------+---------+
    | Column Name | Type    |
    +-------------+---------+
    | student     | varchar |
    | class       | varchar |
    +-------------+---------+
    (student, class) is the primary key column for this table.
    Each row of this table indicates the name of a student and the class in which they are enrolled.

<br>

    Write an SQL query to report all the classes that have at least five students.

    Return the result table in any order.

    The query result format is in the following example.

## Example 1

    Input: 
    Courses table:
    +---------+----------+
    | student | class    |
    +---------+----------+
    | A       | Math     |
    | B       | English  |
    | C       | Math     |
    | D       | Biology  |
    | E       | Math     |
    | F       | Computer |
    | G       | Math     |
    | H       | Math     |
    | I       | Math     |
    +---------+----------+
    Output: 
    +---------+
    | class   |
    +---------+
    | Math    |
    +---------+
    Explanation: 
    - Math has 6 students, so we include it.
    - English has 1 student, so we do not include it.
    - Biology has 1 student, so we do not include it.
    - Computer has 1 student, so we do not include it.

## MySQL query statement

1. First Attempt
```
SELECT class
FROM Courses
HAVING COUNT(student) >= 5;
```

2. Second Attempt
```
SELECT class
FROM Courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(student) >= 5;
```

## What I Learned 

1. GROUP BY

The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".

2. Primary Key

```
In the question, it was said that "(student, class) is the primary key column for this table."
```

    So, I was curious if we can have two primary keys in a table in mysql?

    A primary key is a field in a table which uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table. 
    Primary keys must contain unique values.
    A table can have only one primary key, which may consist of single or multiple fields. 
    When multiple fields are used as a primary key, they are called a composite key.
